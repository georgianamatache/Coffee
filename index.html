        <h1>What makes a coffee great?</h1>
        <p>My journey with coffee started a while ago, of course for its benefits of keeping me awake. Things have evloved a little bit now. If you ask any random group of people, “what is ‘good coffee’?,” you’re going to get extremely varied answer each time. Not just because there are so many varieties, origins, ways of farming, harvesting, roasting, and of course brewing and serving coffee, but simply because—like anything in life—what constitutes “good coffee” is really all about perception and a person’s individual preferences.</p>

        <h2>What exactly is speciality coffee?</h2>
        <p>Besides the taste, one of the major differences, between speciality and regular coffee, is that speciality coffee is actually good for you in more ways than just taste. You’ve probably read some studies about the health benefits of coffee ranging from reduced risk to diabetes, Alzheimers, dementia to preventing various cancers, but remember, even an overdose of the good stuff can lead to some less than wanted effects (e.g. ruining your sleep pattern).</p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Coffee Raises Your Metabolism and Helps You Perform Better Physically</li>
                <p>Studies have shown that drinking coffee can actually raise your metabolism and help you burn fat at a faster rate, thus positively affecting your weight loss. Caffeine does this by stimulating your nervous system, causing it to send signals to your fat cells to break down body fat. (1)
                It also has been shown to improve athletic performance and endurance during exercise. (2)
                Just these two reasons alone are awesome enough to drink more coffee, especially before heading to the gym!
                </p>
                <li> Coffee Is a Great Sources of Antioxidants and Essential Nutrients
                <p>Believe it or not, coffee has a lot of nutritional value. It contains a number of essential nutrients, including riboflavin (11% of the RDA), pantothenic acid (6% of the RDA), manganese (3% of the RDA), potassium (3% of the RDA), magnesium (2% of the RDA) and niacin (2% of the RDA) (3)
                It’s also a HUGE source of antioxidants, and one of the top sources of antioxidants in the American diet. Antioxidants are substances that prevent or delay cell damage, and they can control how fast you age by fighting free radicals. (4)
                Translation…. Coffee makes you pretty and healthy!
                So the next time you look at your coffee, remember it’s not just black water, it’s a tasty source of antioxidants and nutrients.</p>
